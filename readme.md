## Getting Started

To start the project using `nodemon`, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have all the necessary packages installed. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -y

2. **Start the Project:**
    Use nodemon to start the project. nodemon automatically restarts the server whenever file changes are detected. To start the project, run:

    ```bash
    npx nodemon index.js

- This will run the index.js file, and nodemon will keep watching for any changes in your project files.

3. **Access the Application:**
- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the port your application is set to use) to view your running application.

4. **Optional - Install Nodemon Globally:**
    If you haven't already installed nodemon globally, you can do so with the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g nodemon

- Then, you can start your project using:

    ```bash
    nodemon index.js
    
Thatâ€™s it! Your project should now be up and running with nodemon.
